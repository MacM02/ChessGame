# Overview

	December 16th, 2024:
	
	Beginnging to write the our chess game. First implementations include our abstract Piece class. This class will hold
	contract over all classes that inherit the Piece class, such as the Rook, Queen,  Bishop, Pawn, King, and Knight.

	Our board will be made up of a two-dimensional array that holds Pieces. As per common chess fashion, the board will be
	an (8x8) layout.

# Notes

	Trying to understand how unique parts of the game are linked together. 

	Currently believe:

	Models - The pieces/board logic that we will use when instructing the GUI to draw according to object state.

	View - GUI class?

	Controller - ?
